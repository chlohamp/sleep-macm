# Sleep Disorder Meta-analysis

This repository conducts a meta-analytic connectivity modeling analysis for regions that were posed by [Crooks et al. (2025)](manuscript submitted for publication) to be involved in sleep disorders, including parasomnias and dyssomnias.


Centroid cluster coordinates of convergent structural decreases were:

| x    | y    | z   | Label        |
|------|------|-----|--------------|
| -16  | -24  | 10  | lThal        |
|  -8  | -24  | 38  | lCingGyrus   |

Centroid cluster coordinates for identified MACM clusters of convergence were:

| x   | y   | z   | Label     |
|-----|-----|-----|-----------|
| -14 | -10 |  18 | lThal     |
|   0 |   8 | -46 | lSin      |
|  42 | -40 |  40 | rIPL      |
| -10 |   8 |   6 | lCaudate  |
|  -2 | -10 |  38 | lCingGyr  |
